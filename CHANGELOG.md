# Changelog

All notable changes to ResumeBuildz are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

---

## [1.11.0] - 2026-04-15

### Changed

- **Project renamed** from ResumeForge to **ResumeBuildz**. Every user-facing string ("ResumeForge") has been replaced with "ResumeBuildz" across 43 files: site metadata (titles, descriptions, OG/Twitter tags), JSON-LD publisher name, brand logo text in navbar/footer/login/builder/not-found, all in-page copy, testimonials, manifest.json, llms.txt, README, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, LICENSE, .env.example, and all blog/resources/situation/company pages.
- **package.json** name changed from `resumeforge` to `resumebuildz`.
- **Historical CHANGELOG entries** rewritten to say "ResumeBuildz" so brand consistency is preserved for anyone reading the file top-to-bottom (no historical inaccuracy — the product is the same, only the name changed).

### Not changed (technical identifiers — intentional)

- **localStorage keys** (`resumeforge-storage`, `resumeforge-usage-ai`, `resumeforge-usage-pdf`, `resumeforge-last-visit`, `resumeforge-waitlist`, `resumeforge-cookie-consent`, `resumeforge-saved-jds`, `resumeforge-onboarding-done`, `resumeforge-version`) — renaming these would orphan every existing user's saved resume data silently. Kept as-is; the keys are internal and never shown to users.
- **Vercel deployment URL** (`resume-forge-orcin.vercel.app`) — the URL still points to the old Vercel project name. Rename the Vercel project via the dashboard to update the URL; JSON-LD canonical URLs, sitemap.ts, and schema helpers all read from this string and will pick up the new URL once changed.
- **GitHub repo URL** (`github.com/Surya8991/resumeforge`) — rename the repository in GitHub settings to update. References in footer, contributing, security, and meta tags point here and will continue working via GitHub's automatic redirect.
- **Git history** — preserved.

---

## [1.10.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- **Blog section** at `/blog` with topic-cluster discovery layer over existing long-form content:
  - `/blog` hub page with featured strip, topic-cluster cards, and filterable post grid.
  - `/blog/category/[category]` dynamic route with 6 statically generated category pages.
  - `lib/blogCategories.ts` with 6 topic clusters (Resume Writing, ATS & Keywords, Career Transitions, India Hiring, Company Deep Dives, AI Resume Tools) — each with slug, name, description, long description, icon, color, and SEO keywords.
  - `lib/blogPosts.ts` with 8 blog post entries + 1 virtual post (company guides hub link). Each post references its existing page URL — no URL moves, no SEO breakage.
- **Ultimate hero** (`Fill7_Ultimate`) — the most complete hero possible. Mouse-tracked 3D parallax tilt with score chip + suggestion popups floating at different translateZ depths, resume filling in section by section, 4 coaching chips resolving to green checks, ATS score climbing 0% → 94% in lock-step, "ATS-READY" badge at the end, plus a cursor-tracked blue highlight sweep. Applied to the homepage hero.
- **Combined hero** (`Fill6_Combined`) — intermediate version without the tilt. Kept in the preview gallery as option 11.
- Sitemap updated with `/blog` and 6 blog category URLs.

### Changed

- **Resources dropdown in navbar** restructured to point to blog categories instead of flat page links. Now shows: All Articles, Resume Writing, ATS & Keywords, Career Transitions, India Hiring, Company Guides.
- **Homepage hero** replaced with `Fill7_Ultimate` (was `Fill6_Combined`, was static `/templates/modern.png` before that).

---

## [1.9.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- **Long-form article scaffolding** for all 28 content pages (22 company + 6 situation): sticky TOC sidebar (xl+) with mobile accordion, breadcrumb navigation, ArticleMeta bar (author + reading time + last updated + fact-checked badge), JSON-LD Article + FAQPage + HowTo + BreadcrumbList schemas.
- **components/TOC.tsx** — auto-detects h2 elements on mount, assigns stable IDs, uses IntersectionObserver for active-section highlighting, smooth scroll with URL hash update.
- **components/Breadcrumbs.tsx** — visual breadcrumbs with Home icon.
- **components/ArticleMeta.tsx** — author avatar + reading time + last updated + fact-checked badge.
- **components/ReadingProgress.tsx** — thin blue scroll progress bar + back-to-top floating button. Scoped to long-form pages only (not homepage/builder/marketing).
- **lib/articleSchema.ts** — Article / FAQPage / HowTo / BreadcrumbList JSON-LD helpers + combineSchemas() for multi-graph pages.
- **lib/resumeCompanyDataDeep.ts** — 5 new content fields per company: cover letter template (3 paragraphs), 5 common interview questions with hints, 5 red flags that auto-reject, salary benchmark table (3 roles x 3 seniority levels), referral strategy paragraph.
- **5 new sections on every company page**: Cover letter template, interview questions, red flags, salary benchmarks, referral strategy.
- **6 situation pages enriched** with topic-specific additions: email templates (layoff, career gap, career change), comparison tables (fresher chronological vs functional vs hybrid), glossary (fresher resume), case studies (Priya/Rohan/Arjun/Meera/Nikhil — composite stories).
- **/hero-preview internal gallery** at `/hero-preview` with 10 hero variations (5 mouse-tracked tilt + 5 AI-fill animations) for selecting the homepage hero treatment.
- **CSS keyframes** added to globals.css for marquee and floating animations.

### Changed

- **ReadingProgress scope**: moved out of the global `app/layout.tsx` and now only renders on long-form content pages (6 situation pages + CompanyResumeView covers all 22 company pages). Homepage, builder, templates, pricing, auth, and legal pages no longer show the scroll progress bar.
- **Login gateway audit**: every remaining direct `<Link href="/builder">` in app/ replaced with a `<button onClick={() => openGateway('/builder')}>` pattern. Fixed in `app/not-found.tsx`, `app/ats-guide/page.tsx`, `app/cover-letter/page.tsx`. The only remaining `href="/builder"` is the post-login profile dropdown link in the navbar, which is intentional (user is already authenticated).
- **CompanyResumeView** renders 5 additional deep-content sections conditionally when deep data exists (cover letter, questions, red flags, salary, referral).

## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- **22 company resume guides** under `/resume-for/[company]` — 10 global (Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Apple, Deloitte, McKinsey, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Accenture) + 12 India (TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Flipkart, Zomato, Swiggy, Zoho, BYJU'S, PhonePe, Razorpay, Freshworks, Ola).
- **`/resume-for` hub page** listing all 22 companies, segmented by Global vs India tier.
- **`lib/resumeCompanyData.ts`** — single source of truth for all 22 entries (slug, name, tier, industry, hq, hiring focus, 15 ATS keywords, 5 insider tips, recommended template, meta title, meta description). Fully static, no API calls.
- **6 situation-based static pages**: `/fresher-resume`, `/campus-placement-resume`, `/naukri-resume-tips`, `/resume-after-layoff`, `/resume-after-career-gap`, `/resume-for-career-change`. Each is a hand-written long-form guide with internal links, CTAs, and SEO meta tags.
- **Resources dropdown in navbar** exposing all 9 new pages on desktop (with icons) and as a collapsible group on mobile.
- **Dynamic page generation**: `app/resume-for/[company]/page.tsx` uses `generateStaticParams` + `generateMetadata` so all 22 company pages prerender at build time with unique titles and descriptions.
- **Sitemap expanded** by 29 URLs (1 hub + 22 companies + 6 situations).

### Changed

- **SiteNavbar** restructured: Templates is now the first item, followed by a Resources dropdown, then About / Pricing / FAQ / Contact.
- All new pages reuse existing `SiteNavbar`, `SiteFooter`, `useLoginGateway` hook, and the dark gradient hero pattern from `/templates` and `/ats-guide`.

### Added

- **README** alternatives section listing 3 free analytics options (Cloudflare Web Analytics, Umami Cloud, PostHog).

### Changed

- **Homepage Privacy First** card no longer claims "no analytics."
- **About page Mission** statement updated. Stats updated from "0 data sent" to "Free to start" and "Open Source." Tech stack item "Client-side Only" relabeled "Client-side First."

- **Navbar** removed "Resume Builder" from main nav links and added `whitespace-nowrap` to all items. Fixes overflow at 1024px laptop widths.
- **Contact form** now opens user's email client with a pre-filled mailto link instead of pretending to send (no backend yet).

### Page-by-page review fixes

A full top-to-bottom code + live preview review of all 16 pages. Found and fixed:
- Homepage: 3 issues (Template Showcase, Privacy First card, Build My Resume CTA copy)
- About page: 5 issues (mission text, stats, tech stack, hero subtitle, Privacy card)
- Privacy page: 9 sections rewritten for accuracy
- Terms page: 1 section updated

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- **Undo / Redo system** with 50-snapshot history. Ctrl+Z to undo, Ctrl+Y or Ctrl+Shift+Z to redo. Auto-snapshots after 1.5s of inactivity.

### Changed

- **`<img>` to `next/image`** on homepage hero and template thumbnails for better performance and LCP.
- **`React.memo`** on ResumePreview component to prevent re-renders on every keystroke.
- **Weighted completion score** (15% name, 12% email, 15% experience, etc.) instead of flat per-check weighting.
- **Loading states** on export use try/finally instead of setTimeout for accurate UI state.
- **Touch swipe** ignores inputs, draggable handles, sliders, buttons, and contenteditable. Vertical tolerance prevents accidental swipes during scrolls.
- **AI error handling**: granular messages for HTTP 401 (invalid key), 429 (rate limit), 402/403 (quota), and malformed JSON responses.
- **Skills category** now shows `(required)` indicator with amber border when empty.
- **Photo upload** validates MIME type (no SVG) to prevent embedded scripts. Allows JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF only.

### Fixed

- DragEnd handlers in Experience, Education, and Projects forms no longer fail silently when findIndex returns -1.
- ResumeProfileManager memory leak verified as false positive (cleanup is correct).

- `alert()` calls in resume import replaced with toast notifications.

### Security
