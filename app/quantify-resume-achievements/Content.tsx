          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Vague bullets (&quot;improved performance&quot;) tell a recruiter nothing they could verify. Quantified bullets (&quot;cut build times from 8 minutes to 90 seconds&quot;) give a concrete claim + scale + outcome in one line. Recruiters trust them more, hiring managers remember them longer, and some ATS ranking algorithms explicitly weight bullets containing digits higher because numbers signal specificity.

          The single move that separates amateur resumes from professional ones is quantification. This guide gives you the formula, shows you where to find numbers even when you think you have none, and provides 50+ examples across 8 common roles you can adapt directly.

          {[
            { q: 'How many bullets on my resume should have numbers?', a: 'At least 60%. Ideally every bullet has at least one piece of quantification: a count, percentage, scale, or timeframe. Bullets without numbers should at minimum have concrete nouns (named tools, stakeholders, outputs).' },
            { q: 'Can I round numbers for readability?', a: 'Yes, within reason. Round to the nearest easily-grasped figure (14k not 14,237), but do not inflate. If challenged in an interview, you should be able to cite the true figure.' },
            { q: 'What if my company is confidential about numbers?', a: 'Use relative figures and scope indicators. "Grew the book 4x over 18 months" works without revealing absolute revenue. "Across our top 5 enterprise accounts" works without naming them.' },
            { q: 'Should I use % or absolute numbers?', a: 'Both when possible. "Cut CAC 40% (Rs 1,200 to Rs 720)" is stronger than either alone. Percentages establish relative impact; absolutes establish scale.' },
            { q: 'Is it okay to estimate?', a: 'Only if the estimate is defensible. "Trained approximately 40 staff members" is fine if you remember running 4 cohorts of 10. "Increased sales by roughly 25%" is weasel-worded; find the real number or leave it out.' },
            { q: 'Does AI help with quantification?', a: 'It helps you find the right format. It cannot invent the numbers. Useful workflow: tell AI the raw context (what you did, the team size, any outcomes you remember) and ask it to draft a quantified bullet. Then verify the number yourself before pasting.' },
