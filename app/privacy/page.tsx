You can clear this data anytime through your browser settings or by clicking Reset in the builder.",

If you create an account via Supabase auth (Google or email/password), we store: your email address, full name (if provided via Google), avatar URL (if provided via Google), and your Pro plan tier. We do NOT store your resume content on our servers. Your resume always lives in your browser.",

    title: 'Analytics',

It records aggregate page views, top referrers, country, and device type. It does not collect personal information, IP addresses, or session recordings. This helps us understand which features are popular without compromising your privacy.",

When you use this feature, your resume data is sent directly from your browser to Groq\'s servers — it never passes through our servers. We do not have access to your API key or the data you send to Groq. Please review Groq\'s privacy policy for information about how they handle your data.',

When the Pro plan launches, we will migrate to a proper email service (such as Resend or Supabase). At that point, you will be notified once and your email will be removed if you do not respond.",

    title: 'Data Security',
    content: 'Your resume content lives in your browser and is never transmitted to our servers. Account data (email, name) is stored by Supabase, which provides industry-standard security including encryption at rest and in transit, regular backups, and SOC 2 compliance. We follow security best practices including HSTS, CSP headers, and OAuth redirect whitelisting.',

    title: 'GDPR & Your Rights',
    content: 'You have the right to export your data (Profile dropdown → Export My Data) and the right to delete your account (Profile dropdown → Delete Account). Account deletion permanently removes your profile from our database and clears your local resume data. EU users can exercise these rights at any time without contacting support.',
