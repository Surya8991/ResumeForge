              <p>
                ResumeBuildz is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) product. There are no physical
                goods to ship. &quot;Delivery&quot; in this policy refers to activation of your paid plan
                and access to the features purchased.

                Paid plans are activated <strong>immediately</strong> upon successful payment
                confirmation from our payment processor (Razorpay or Stripe). In the rare event
                of a processing delay, activation is guaranteed within <strong>60 minutes</strong>.
