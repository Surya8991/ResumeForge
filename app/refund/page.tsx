              <p>
                If you are not satisfied with your paid plan, you may request a full refund within
                <strong> 7 days of your first payment</strong>. To request a refund, email{' '}

                  suryaraj8147@gmail.com

                The 7-day refund window does not apply to renewal charges on recurring
                subscriptions. To avoid a renewal charge, cancel your subscription before the
                renewal date (see Section 4).

              <p>
                Monthly and annual subscriptions renew automatically until cancelled. You can
                cancel at any time from your account settings → Manage Plan, or by emailing us.
                Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period — you retain
                access to paid features until then, and you will not be charged again.

                Lifetime plan is a one-time payment with no renewals. The 7-day refund window
                (Section 3) applies. After 7 days, Lifetime purchases are non-refundable except
                where required by applicable consumer protection law.

              <p>
                If you are charged twice for the same order, or a payment fails after the amount
                has been debited from your bank, email us with the transaction ID and we will
                refund the duplicate or reconcile the failed charge within 5 business days. No
                questions asked, no 7-day limit.

              <p>
                Before raising a chargeback with your bank, please email us first — almost every
                issue is resolvable directly and faster than the chargeback process. Chargebacks
                raised without prior contact may result in account suspension pending review.
