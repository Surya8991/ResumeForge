        <div className="bg-indigo-50 border-l-4 border-indigo-500 rounded-r-lg p-5 mb-8">
          <p className="font-semibold text-indigo-900 mb-2">What a resume summary is</p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            A resume summary is a 2 to 4 sentence paragraph at the top of your resume that names your role, years of relevant experience, 1 to 2 specialties, and 1 measurable achievement. It sits below your contact information and above the Experience section. Done right, it is the single line that decides whether a recruiter reads the rest. Done wrong, it is filler. Most candidates default to filler.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          The summary is the highest-leverage 40 words on your resume. A strong one tells a recruiter in one breath: what you do, how long you have been doing it, what you are good at, and what you have shipped. The trick is writing it without slipping into generic phrases like &quot;results-driven&quot; or &quot;passionate about&quot; that read as LinkedIn boilerplate.
        </p>

      <section id="vs-objective" className="mt-12 scroll-mt-6">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Resume summary vs objective: which should you use in 2026?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Summary</strong>: focuses on what you offer. &quot;Senior PM with 6 years at Swiggy who shipped reorder flow that drove +14% weekly actives.&quot;
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3">
          <strong>Objective</strong>: focuses on what you want. &quot;Seeking a Product Manager role at a fast-growing consumer tech company.&quot;
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3">
          In 2026, <strong>use a summary, not an objective</strong>, in almost every case. Objectives date from an era when HR needed to sort applications into role categories. Modern ATS does that automatically based on job posting. The one exception: very early-career candidates with no work history can use a short Objective to clarify direction, but a well-framed Summary still works better.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">How AI can help you write a better summary</h2>
        <p>
          AI is great at turning your raw bullet points into a tight summary. It is bad at inventing specifics you have not supplied. The useful workflow:
        </p>
        <ol className="mt-5 space-y-3 list-decimal pl-5">
          <li><strong>Dump raw facts first.</strong> Years in role, 2 to 3 shipped projects with numbers, the domain you want to target next.</li>
          <li><strong>Ask AI to compress into 3 sentences using the 4-part formula.</strong> Specify: 75 words max, no adjectives, open with title + years.</li>
          <li><strong>Rewrite sentence 1 by hand.</strong> AI tends to generic wording there. You know your own title/years best.</li>
          <li><strong>Check every claim has a supporting bullet below.</strong> Delete the claim if not.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="mt-4">
          ResumeBuildz&apos;s AI assistant does this compression with the builder context already loaded, so it can pull the specifics from your own experience bullets instead of hallucinating them. One click, no copy-paste.

          {[

            { q: 'Should the summary include skills?', a: '1 to 2 core specialties, named. Not a full skill list. That goes in the Skills section. The summary is narrative, the Skills section is scannable.' },
            { q: 'Can I use ChatGPT to write my summary?', a: 'Yes, as a compression tool. No, as a first-draft generator if you feed it nothing about yourself. AI output is only as specific as your input.' },
            { q: 'Do recruiters actually read the summary?', a: 'About 65 to 70 percent do. The rest skip to Experience directly. That means your top bullet must also stand alone. But for the 65% who read it, a strong summary is the single highest-impact sentence on your resume.' },
            { q: 'What if my background is non-linear?', a: 'Lead with the role you are targeting next, not the last role you held. "Growth marketer (5 yrs) after 3 years in equity research. Specialize in data-driven acquisition..."' },
            { q: 'How is a resume summary different from a LinkedIn About?', a: 'Resume summary: 40 to 90 words, dense, past tense or present perfect, zero personality. LinkedIn About: 200 to 400 words, allowed to have voice and narrative arc. Do not paste one into the other.' },
