const FAQS = [
  { q: 'How long is "too long" for a career gap?', a: 'There is no hard limit, but after 2 years the conversation shifts: for gaps under 2 years, a one-line explanation suffices. For gaps 2 to 5 years, you need evidence of upskilling during the gap. For gaps over 5 years, target returnship programs, freelance-to-full-time paths, or adjacent-but-lower roles as a re-entry point.' },
  { q: 'Should I list a "Career Break" entry on my timeline?', a: 'Yes if the gap is 6+ months. Treat it as a regular entry with start and end dates. Example: "Career Break | Mar 2023 to Present | Full-time caregiver for immediate family. Completed Google Data Analytics certificate during this period."' },
  { q: 'Do I need to mention the gap in my cover letter?', a: 'Yes, in one sentence. Recruiters appreciate transparency. "After a [reason] break, I am returning to work with renewed focus on [target role]." Do not dwell; move on to your value proposition in the next sentence.' },
  { q: 'Will ATS systems reject me for a gap?', a: 'No. Modern ATS parse dates but do not reject based on gaps. The rejection happens at the human screening stage when a recruiter sees an unexplained gap. Name it explicitly and the rejection risk drops significantly.' },
  { q: 'Should I remove old jobs to hide the gap?', a: 'No. Lying or omitting is worse than the gap itself. Background checks will catch discrepancies. List the dates honestly and frame the gap positively.' },
  { q: 'Is a "functional" resume better for career gaps?', a: 'No. Pure functional resumes (skills-only, no timeline) are seen as hiding something and hurt you. Use a hybrid format: skills at the top, then a chronological timeline that includes the career break as an explicit entry.' },

During that time I stayed current in [domain] by completing [specific certification, course, freelance project, or volunteer work] and I am fully ready to return to a full-time role.\n\nI would love the opportunity to discuss how my [N] years of experience in [specific domain] maps to what your team is building.

const CASE_STUDY_GAP = {
  title: 'Case study: Meera returned after a 3-year gap',
  story: `Meera had 8 years of marketing experience at two SaaS companies before taking a 3-year career break to care for her young children. When she started applying again in early 2025, her first 20 applications got zero responses. Every cover letter apologised for the gap.\n\nShe switched strategies. She rewrote her summary to lead with accomplishments ("Grew a B2B SaaS demand-gen engine from $400k to $6.2M ARR") and added one factual line at the end: "Returning to work after a 3-year family care break. Completed HubSpot Inbound Marketing certification and 2 freelance projects during this period."\n\nShe also applied to Goldman Sachs returnship program as a backup. The returnship did not materialise. She got 4 interviews from her first 25 tailored applications after the rewrite, and accepted a senior marketing role at a healthtech startup.\n\nThe turning point was reframing the gap from "apologise and explain" to "stated once, then moved on to value."`,
};

const RULES = [
  'Be honest, brief, and unapologetic. One factual line is enough. Never bury the gap, never over-explain it.',
  'Use a "Career Break" entry on the resume timeline. Treat it like any other entry with start and end dates.',
  'Show what you did during the gap: courses, freelance, side projects, volunteering, open source, certifications.',
  'Update your most recent skills near the top so recruiters see currency, not staleness.',
  'In the cover letter, address the gap once in one sentence, then move forward. Never apologise.',
  'For long gaps (2+ years), add a one-line "Returnship interest" note in your summary if applying to formal returnship programs.',
