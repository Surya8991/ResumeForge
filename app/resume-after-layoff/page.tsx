Address the layoff once in your cover letter in one neutral sentence, then move on.',

  {
    q: 'How do I explain a layoff in interviews?',
    a: 'One sentence, neutral tone, no detail: "My team was part of a company-wide reorganization in [month]. I\'m now focused on finding a [role] where I can [specific contribution]." Do not apologise, do not speculate on why you were chosen, do not share internal gossip about the company.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is it worth mentioning severance or notice period?',
    a: 'Only if the recruiter directly asks. Never put it on the resume. Never volunteer it in your first call. If asked, be factual: "I\'m on a 2-month paid notice period and my last working day is [date]."',
  },
  {
    q: 'Should I take a lower-paying role to bridge the gap?',
    a: 'Depends on runway. If you have 6+ months of savings, hold out for a role at your previous level. If you have under 3 months, a bridge role is often smarter — gaps past 6 months become harder to explain. An honest temporary role is better than a stretched gap.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What if I was laid off from a high-profile company like Google, Meta, or TCS?',
    a: 'Use it as a signal, not a liability. Being part of a publicly-reported layoff wave at a top company is now widely understood. Recruiters at competing companies actively source from these layoffs. Make sure your LinkedIn says "Open to work" and list the former employer prominently.',

She spent the first week processing the shock, then applied the framework on this page. By week two she had a fully rewritten one-page resume leading with a quantified outcome: "Grew weekly active users from 41k to 87k in 12 months." She updated LinkedIn with a simple "Open to work — product management roles" banner and started applying to 15 roles per week.\n\nIn month two, she added three volunteer product reviews for a local non-profit to show continued momentum. She also signed up for Goldman Sachs\' returnship program as a backup path, though she ultimately didn't need it. By the end of month three she had 6 interviews and 2 offers. She accepted a role at a larger company at a 14% higher base salary than her previous job.\n\nThe difference-maker wasn't luck — it was a quantified, forward-looking resume (not apologetic), an updated LinkedIn on day one, and a disciplined 15-applications-per-week rhythm rather than spray-and-pray.`,

              A layoff is not a performance issue. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, roughly 20 million workers experience involuntary separation each year, and the majority find new roles within 4 months. The candidates who land fastest share three traits: a quantified, forward-looking resume; a calm, factual cover letter; and an updated LinkedIn that matches both.
