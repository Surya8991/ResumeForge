const FAQS = [
  { q: 'Should I put "Laid Off" on my resume?', a: 'No. The resume is a sales document, not an incident report. You can optionally add "(Company-wide reorg, Sep 2024)" next to the end date if you want to preempt the question, but most recruiters already know. 2024 and 2025 tech layoffs have been heavily publicised. Address the layoff once in your cover letter in one neutral sentence, then move on.' },
  { q: 'How do I explain a layoff in interviews?', a: 'One sentence, neutral tone, no detail: "My team was part of a company-wide reorganisation in [month]. I am now focused on finding a [role] where I can [specific contribution]." Do not apologise, do not speculate on why you were chosen, do not share internal gossip about the company.' },
  { q: 'Is it worth mentioning severance or notice period?', a: 'Only if the recruiter directly asks. Never put it on the resume. Never volunteer it in your first call. If asked, be factual: "I am on a 2-month paid notice period and my last working day is [date]."' },
  { q: 'Should I take a lower-paying role to bridge the gap?', a: 'Depends on runway. If you have 6+ months of savings, hold out for a role at your previous level. If you have under 3 months, a bridge role is often smarter. Gaps past 6 months become harder to explain. An honest temporary role is better than a stretched gap.' },
  { q: 'What if I was laid off from a high-profile company like Google, Meta, or TCS?', a: 'Use it as a signal, not a liability. Being part of a publicly-reported layoff wave at a top company is now widely understood. Recruiters at competing companies actively source from these layoffs. Make sure your LinkedIn says "Open to work" and list the former employer prominently.' },

  title: 'Case study: Priya, laid off from a tech firm in July 2024',
  story: `Priya was a mid-level product manager at a fast-growing SaaS company when she was laid off as part of a 15% company-wide reduction in July 2024. She spent the first week processing the shock, then applied the framework on this page. By week two she had a fully rewritten one-page resume leading with a quantified outcome: "Grew weekly active users from 41k to 87k in 12 months." She updated LinkedIn with a simple "Open to work. Product management roles" banner and started applying to 15 roles per week.\n\nIn month two, she added three volunteer product reviews for a local non-profit to show continued momentum. She also signed up for Goldman Sachs returnship program as a backup path, though she ultimately did not need it. By the end of month three she had 6 interviews and 2 offers. She accepted a role at a larger company at a 14% higher base salary than her previous job.\n\nThe difference-maker was not luck. It was a quantified, forward-looking resume (not apologetic), an updated LinkedIn on day one, and a disciplined 15-applications-per-week rhythm rather than spray-and-pray.`,

  { title: 'Step 3: Pick a forward-looking summary', body: 'Your professional summary should describe what you do and what you want next, not what just happened. Example: "Senior product manager with 8 years scaling B2B SaaS from seed to Series C. Now seeking a 0-to-1 product role at an early-stage startup."' },
