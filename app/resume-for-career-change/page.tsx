const STEPS = [
  { title: '1. Identify your transferable skills', body: 'Career changers underestimate how much carries over. Project management, stakeholder communication, data analysis, budgeting, mentorship. Almost all of these transfer. Make a list of 10 skills from your old role and rate which ones the new role needs.' },
  { title: '2. Pick a functional or hybrid format', body: 'For traditional career changes, a chronological resume highlights the wrong things. Use a hybrid format: skills section at the top, then experience. This puts your transferable skills in front of the recruiter before they see your unrelated job titles.' },
  { title: '3. Rewrite the summary as a bridge', body: 'Your summary is the bridge from "what I did" to "what I want to do next." Example: "Marketing manager with 7 years driving B2B demand gen, transitioning into product management. Strong customer empathy, data-driven decision making, and 2 years of side-project shipping experience."' },
  { title: '4. Translate every bullet into the new domain', body: 'Strip out industry jargon from the old field. "Closed $2M ARR pipeline" becomes "Identified customer needs and shipped solutions worth $2M in measurable value." The work was the same; the language meets the new audience.' },
  { title: '5. Show evidence of the new direction', body: 'Recruiters need proof you are serious. Side projects, certifications, courses, freelance work, volunteer roles, blog posts. Anything that demonstrates you have already started moving toward the new field. List these in a "Relevant Projects" section above experience.' },
];

const TIMELINE_EXPECTATIONS = [
  { phase: 'Months 1-2', desc: 'Self-assessment, skill gap analysis, picking a target field, starting 1-2 relevant courses or certifications.' },
  { phase: 'Months 3-6', desc: 'Building 2-3 side projects, getting 1 unpaid or volunteer experience, rewriting your resume as hybrid format, updating LinkedIn.' },
  { phase: 'Months 6-9', desc: 'Active applications with tailored bullets, informational interviews with 15-20 people in the new field, interview prep.' },
  { phase: 'Months 9-12', desc: 'Landing the first role in the new field. Usually at a level lower than your previous role, with room to climb back up fast.' },
];

const COMMON_TRAPS = [
  'Expecting the same seniority in the new field. Most pivots involve a 1-level demotion in title (and sometimes pay) for 12-18 months before you re-enter at your old level.',
  'Applying without evidence. Recruiters for the new field expect at least 1-2 projects, an internship, or a certification before taking your pivot seriously.',
  'Leading the cover letter with "I want to transition." This sounds like you need something. Lead with what you bring instead.',
  'Ignoring network value. Referrals convert 4-5x better than cold applications for career changers. Spend 40% of your time on networking, not applications.',
  'Lying about experience to match the JD. Background checks and technical interviews will catch this and burn the bridge.',
];

const FAQS = [
  { q: 'How long does a career change realistically take?', a: '6 to 12 months for most pivots, assuming you are working on it consistently while still employed. Longer if the new field requires formal credentials (e.g., engineering to medicine). Shorter for adjacent pivots (e.g., customer success to product management).' },
  { q: 'Will I have to take a pay cut?', a: 'Usually yes, at least initially. Expect a 10-25% pay cut for the first role in the new field. Most career changers return to their pre-pivot compensation within 18-24 months and often exceed it within 3-4 years because the new field aligns better with their strengths.' },
  { q: 'Should I go back to school for a career change?', a: 'Rarely necessary. For most pivots (marketing to PM, engineering to consulting, finance to ops), a 3-6 month certification + side project portfolio beats a 2-year degree. Formal degrees only make sense when the target field has hard credentialing requirements (law, medicine, architecture, academia).' },
  { q: 'Is a bootcamp worth it for engineering pivots?', a: 'Sometimes. Top bootcamps can work for motivated career changers with a strong work ethic. But the return has dropped since 2023. Tech hiring is tighter, and bootcamp grads compete with laid-off senior engineers. Do 2 to 3 months of free pre-work (freeCodeCamp, CS50) before committing cash.' },
  { q: 'How do I explain the pivot to a hiring manager?', a: 'Use a 3-sentence script: (1) What you did before and what you were good at, (2) Why that experience makes you ready for this new field, (3) What specific recent work proves it. Example: "I spent 6 years in sales, where I learned to diagnose customer problems fast and communicate across stakeholders. Those skills translate directly to product management. Over the past 8 months, I have shipped 3 side projects and completed the Reforge PM foundations course."' },
  { q: 'Should my LinkedIn headline reflect the new field?', a: 'Yes, gradually. Use a transition headline: "Software Engineer | Aspiring Product Manager | Shipping side projects with user research." This signals direction without lying about your current title. Once you land your first PM role, update it fully.' },
];

  title: 'Case study: Nikhil pivoted from sales to product management',
  story: `Nikhil spent 6 years in B2B sales at a SaaS company, consistently hitting 110%+ of quota and managing key enterprise accounts. He decided to pivot into product management because he was more energised by discovery calls and customer research than by closing deals.\n\nHis first mistake: applying to senior PM roles at product companies with a straight chronological resume. Zero responses over 40 applications. The pivot framework on this page fixed it.\n\nHe rewrote the resume to a hybrid format, leading with "Customer-obsessed operator transitioning into product management" in the summary. He added a "Relevant Projects" section above experience that listed 3 PM-adjacent side projects: user research interviews he ran for a local non-profit, a prototype customer feedback portal he built in Notion, and a Reforge PM Foundations certification.\n\nIn experience, he rewrote sales bullets in PM language: "Identified and synthesised customer needs for 24 Fortune 500 accounts, shaping the product roadmap via direct feedback loops with product and engineering."\n\nOver 3 months he got 5 interviews for Associate PM roles and accepted a role at a mid-stage startup at a 12% pay cut. Within 18 months he was promoted to PM and exceeded his previous sales compensation.`,
